The vb2Py project goals are develop a suite of conversion tools to aid in translating existing Visual Basic projects into Python.

The conversion includes,
  * VB code modules translating to Python code modules
  * VB classes to Python classes
  * VB Forms to gui2py forms
  * VB Projects to gui2py projects

The project also aims to support translation of VB Script, ASP and VBA code into Python equivalent code.

**NOTE**: This is a experimental fork of the original project at http://vb2py.sourceforge.net/
